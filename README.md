This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Simple UI Library

To use this UI library in your React project:

1. Copy the `UILibrary.tsx` file into your project.
2. Make sure you have Tailwind CSS set up in your project for styling.
3. Import and use the components in your React components as follows:

```jsx
import { Button, Card, Input } from './path/to/UILibrary';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card title="Example Card">
        <Input placeholder="Enter your name" />
        <Button variant="primary">Submit</Button>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
